# HMEP Repository

## Description
This repository contains code and resources for the HMEP project. It is designed for data processing, analysis, and modeling using Python.

## Dataset Information
- **Primary Dataset**: Please refer to the [Visual Genome](https://visualgenome.org/) dataset.The original dataset can be downloaded via this link https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ranjay/visualgenome/api.html
- **Other Data Sources**: See respective sections or code comments for details.

## Code Information
- All scripts are written in Python.
- Main functionalities include data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shawnBlue957/Repository-for-HMEP.git
    cd Repository-for-HMEP
    ```
2. **Install requirements**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Prepare the dataset**:
    - Download the Visual Genome dataset from the official website or Zenodo.
    - Place the downloaded files in the `data/` directory.

4. **Run preprocessing**:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```

5. **Train or analyze models**:
    - Depending on your workflow, use `train.py` or other provided scripts.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`):
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - torch (if using deep learning modules)
  - tqdm
  - (and others as specified)

## Methods
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, cleaning, and transforming raw datasets into structured formats.
    - If no preprocessing is required, this will be stated in relevant scripts.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from images and text for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Training machine learning or deep learning models for data analysis or prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using standard metrics.
